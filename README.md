# Quantum Fourier Transform and Qubit Visualization

This project demonstrates the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and qubit visualization using Qiskit in a Jupyter notebook. The simulation showcases quantum computing concepts and provides visual insights into qubit states and their transformations.

## Project Overview

- Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT): This is a key quantum algorithm used for transforming quantum states into the Fourier basis.
- Qubit Visualization: Visualizes the qubit states at different stages of the quantum circuit.
- **Simulation in Qiskit:** All the simulations and visualizations are performed using IBM's open-source quantum computing framework, Qiskit, in a Jupyter notebook.

## Features

- Implements Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm and Circuit
- Visualizes qubit states 
- Demonstrates quantum gates used in QFT
- Includes Qiskit simulation for step-by-step execution
